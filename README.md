# coffee and tea
Charlie 2023 cohort at LEARN Academy has an interest in reaching for the stars, and the students independently decided to build a side project to strengthen their foundational skills, stretch into new concepts, and further develop a sense of teamwork and working within projects. This project of building a coffee making game application was built by a subset of Charlie 2023 cohort.
